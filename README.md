Hello there,

To run the player application, navigate to src -> playermain. Right click on Main.java and hover over "Run as JAVA APPLICATION". 

-On execution, splash screen with team credits should appear with the word MAIN GAME at the bottom showing that it is running the player application.

Only the first level is available for navigation ("locked" and level 2 and 3 should not be available). Click on puzzle level 1 button. The puzzle format of the level for the player should appear as it would look during game play without moves for now. Click on the back button to go back to the map, and click the back button to go back to the main menu. 
-Click on "Play Custom Levels" which will take you to the custom level map which should show 15 levels with most being empty. Again, only the first level button will be functional. Click on the back button to go back to the main menu.
